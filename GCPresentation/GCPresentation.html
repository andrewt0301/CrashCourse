<ul>
<li>Find data objects in the program, that cannot be accessed in the future</li>
<li>Reclaim resources used by these objects</li>
<li>So, <b>Garbage Collection</b> is automatic reclamation of computer memory storage.</li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-org8e32a23">
<h3 id="org8e32a23"><b><span class="underline">Advantages</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Getting rid of dangling pointer bugs</li>
<li>Getting rid of double free bugs</li>
<li>Getting rid of certain type of memory leaks</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org96e1cd8">
<h3 id="org96e1cd8"><b><span class="underline">Disadvantages</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Extra computing resources</li>
<li>Unpredictable collection time</li>
<li>More memory-related work than useful work</li>

<h3 id="org28a646e"><b><span class="underline">Conclusion</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Studies showed that performance of systems with well-implemented garbage collectiors is highly competitive with systems with explicit deallocation.</li>
<li>Automatic deallocation allows a programmer not to worry about memory management, increasing writeability of a system, and decreasing development time and costs.</li>
<li>Explicit management introduces possibilities for making errors in memory management, and thus, decreases reliability.</li>
<li>Garbage collection promotes purely modular design - explicit deallocation causes one module to be responsible for knowing that other modules are not interested in this particular object.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="orgc1087d4"><b><span class="underline">Brief History</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Automatic Garbage Collector</b>
<ul>
<li>First automatic garbage collection:
<ul>
<li>LISP (1958)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Several other languages implemented it:
<ul>
<li>BASIC (1964)</li>
<li>Logo (1967)</li>
<li>Java 1.0 (1996)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Dangling pointers</b> or <b>wild pointers</b> in computer programming are pointers that do not point to a valid object of the appropriate type. These are special cases of memory safety violations. More generally, dangling references and wild references are references that do not resolve to a valid destination.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>JNI</b> is a programming framework that enables Java code running in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to call and be called by native applications (programs specific to a hardware and operating system platform) and libraries written in other languages such as C, C++ and assembly.</li>

<h3 id="orgb6c6ff2"><b><span class="underline">Garbage Collection Roots</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>A garbage collection root is an object that is accessible from outside the heap. Every object tree must have one or more root objects. As long as the application can reach those roots, the whole tree is reachable.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org3c1c942">
<h3 id="org3c1c942"><b><span class="underline">Garbage Collection Roots</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Local variables</b>: input parameters or locally created objects of methods that are still in the stack of a thread. For all intents and purposes, local variables are GC roots.</li>
<li><b>Active threads</b>: A started, but not stopped thread are always considered live objects and are therefore GC roots. This is especially important for thread local variables.</li>
<li><b>Static variables</b>: are referenced by their classes. This fact makes them de facto GC roots. Classes themselves can be garbage-collected, which would remove all referenced static variables.</li>
<li><b>JNI References</b> are objects that the native code has created as part of a JNI call. Objects thus created are treated specially because the JVM does not know if it is being referenced by the native code or not.</li>

<li><b>JNI Local</b>: Local variable in native code, such as user defined JNI code or JVM internal code.</li>
<li><b>JNI Global</b>: Global variable in native code, such as user defined JNI code or JVM internal code.</li>
<li><b>Thread Block</b>: Object referred to from a currently active thread block.</li>
<li><b>Busy Monitor</b>: Everything that has called <code>wait()</code> or <code>notify()</code> or that is synchronized.</li>
<li><b>Native Stack</b>: In or out parameters in native code, such as user defined JNI code or JVM internal code.</li>

<ul>
<li>A simple Java application has the following GC roots:

<h3 id="orgb76f13c"><b><span class="underline">OopMap Structure</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>OopMap is a structure that records where object references (OOPs) are located on the Java stack. Its primary purpose is to find <b><span class="underline">GC roots</span></b> on Java stacks and to update the references whenever objects are moved within the Heap.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgde606e5">
<h3 id="orgde606e5"><b><span class="underline">OopMap Structure</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>There are three kinds of OopMaps:
<ul>
<li>OopMaps for <b>interpreted methods</b>. They are computed lazily, i.e. when GC happens, by analyzing bytecode flow.</li>
<li>OopMaps for <b>JIT-compiled methods</b>. They are generated during JIT-compilation and kept along with the compiled code so that VM can quickly find by instruction address the stack locations and the registers where the object references are held.</li>
<li>OopMaps for generated <b>shared runtime stubs</b>. These maps are constructed manually by the developers - authors of these runtime stubs.</li>

</ul></li>

<h3 id="org59dd576"><b><span class="underline">GC Safepoints</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>A <b><span class="underline">GC Safepoints</span></b> is a point or range in a thread's execution where the collector can identify all the references in that thread's execution stack.
<ul>
<li><b>GC Safepoints</b> and <b>Safepoints</b> are often used interchangeable</li>
<li>But there are other types of safepoints, including ones that require more information than a GC safepoint does (e.g. deoptimization)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>"Bringing a thread to a safepoint" is a act of getting a thread to reach a safepoint and not execute past it
<ul>
<li>Close to, but not exactly the same as "stop at a safepoint", for example JNI: you can keep running in, but not past the safepoint</li>
<li>Safepoint opportunities are (or should be) frequent</li>

</ul></li>
<li>In a <span class="underline">Global Safepoint</span> all threads are at a Safepoint</li>

<li>Reference counting is a simple algorithm, and is relatively easy to implement correctly.</li>
<li>Memory reclamation is interleaved with program execution, and is hence "real-time".

<li>The counter may take up memory space large enough to represent any number of pointers that might exist in the entire system. <i>Remedies</i>:
<ul>
<li>Use a smaller field to store counts, and mark all unaccounted-for objects when the field's maximum count is reached.</li>
<li>Use another garbage collection method  (usually of a tracing type) to reclaim all marked objects and other objects reachable by the pointers in the full field.</li>

First it must write a pointer from a black object to a white object, and second, it must destroy the original pointer to the white object before the collector gets to it.

<ul>
<li>Oracle HotSpot JVM has four types of GC implementations:
<ul>
<li>Serial Garbage Collector</li>
<li>Parallel Garbage Collector</li>
<li>CMS Garbage Collector</li>
<li>G1 Garbage Collector</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org3f7cebd">
<h3 id="org3f7cebd"><b><span class="underline">Serial Garbage Collector</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>This is the simplest GC implementation, as it basically works with a single thread. As a result, <b>this GC implementation freezes all application threads</b> when it runs. Hence, it is not a good idea to use it in multi-threaded applications like server environments.</li>
<li>The <i>Serial GC</i> is the garbage collector of choice for most applications that do not have small pause time requirements and run on client-style machines. To enable <i>Serial Garbage Collector</i>, we can use the following argument:
<ul>
<li><code>java -XX:+UseSerialGC -jar Application.java</code></li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org51cc17b">
<h3 id="org51cc17b"><b><span class="underline">Parallel Garbage Collector</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s the default GC of the JVM and sometimes called <i>Throughput Collector</i>. Unlike <i>Serial Garbage Collector</i>, this <b>uses multiple threads for managing heap space</b>. But it also <b>freezes other application threads</b> while performing GC.</li>

<li>The numbers of garbage collector threads can be controlled with the command-line option <code>-XX:ParallelGCThreads=&lt;N&gt;</code>.</li>

<li>The maximum pause time goal (gap [in milliseconds] between two GC)is specified with the command-line option <code>-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=&lt;N&gt;</code>.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org1928632">
<h3 id="org1928632"><b><span class="underline">Parallel Garbage Collector</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>The maximum throughput target (measured regarding the time spent doing garbage collection versus the time spent outside of garbage collection) is specified by the command-line option <code>-XX:GCTimeRatio=&lt;N&gt;</code>.</li>

<li>Maximum heap footprint (the amount of heap memory that a program requires while running) is specified using the option <code>-Xmx&lt;N&gt;</code>.</li>

<li>To enable Parallel Garbage Collector, we can use the following argument:
<ul>
<li><code>java -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar Application.java</code></li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-orga5af50f">
<h3 id="orga5af50f"><b><span class="underline">Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Garbage Collector</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS)</i> implementation <b>uses multiple garbage collector threads</b> for garbage collection. It’s designed for applications that prefer shorter garbage collection pauses, and that can afford <b>to share processor resources with the garbage collector while the application is running</b>.</li>

<li>Applications using this type of GC respond slower on average but do not stop responding to perform garbage collection.</li>

<li>If more than 98% of the total time is spent in CMS garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is recovered, then an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> is thrown by the <i>CMS collector</i>. If necessary, this feature can be disabled by adding the option <code>-XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit</code> to the command line.</li>

<li>To enable the <i>CMS Garbage Collector</i>, we can use the following flag:

<ul>
<li><code>java -XX:+USeParNewGC -jar Application.java</code></li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-orgdb19213">
<h3 id="orgdb19213"><b><span class="underline">Garbage First (G1) Garbage Collector</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li><i>G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector</i> is designed <b>for applications running on multi-processor machines with large memory space</b>. It’s available since JDK7 Update 4 and in later releases.</li>

<li><i>G1 collector</i> will replace the CMS collector since it’s more performance efficient.</li>

<li>Unlike other collectors, <i>G1 collector</i> partitions the heap into a set of equal-sized heap regions, each a contiguous range of virtual memory. When performing garbage collections, G1 shows a concurrent global marking phase (i.e. phase 1 known as Marking) to determine the liveness of objects throughout the heap.</li>

<li>After the mark phase is completed, G1 knows which regions are mostly empty. It collects in these areas first, which usually yields a significant amount of free space (i.e. phase 2 known as Sweeping). It is why this method of garbage collection is called <i>Garbage-First</i>.</li>

<li>To enable <i>G1 Garbage Collector</i>, we can use the following argument:

<ul>
<li><code>java -XX:+UseG1GC -jar Application.java</code></li>

</ul></li>
